# JSStrings - JavaScript String and Comment Extractor

`JSStrings` is a Node.js command-line tool that parses a JavaScript file and extracts all string literals and comments.

## Features

*   Parses JavaScript files using the `acorn` library.
*   Extracts all string literals (e.g., `"hello"`, `'world'`).
*   Extracts all comments (both block `/* ... */` and line `// ...`), trimming whitespace.
*   Prints each extracted string or comment on a new line.

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Version 8.x or newer recommended (due to `fs.readFile` and `acorn` usage).
*   **npm**: Comes with Node.js.

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to the `jsstrings` project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/new-hacks/jsstrings
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command reads `package.json` and installs the `acorn` parser.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with the path to a JavaScript file as a command-line argument:
```bash
node index.js <filepath.js>
```

### Example

Suppose you have a file `test.js`:
```javascript
// This is a test comment
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
let anotherString = 'Acorn parser';
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */
var num = 123; // Another comment here
```

Running the tool:
```bash
node index.js test.js
```

Example Output:
```
This is a test comment
Hello, world!
Acorn parser
This is a
   multi-line comment
Another comment here
```
(Note: The order of comments and strings in the output depends on their appearance in the token stream generated by `acorn`.)

## How it Works
The script uses the `fs` module to read the specified JavaScript file. It then utilizes the `acorn.tokenizer` to parse the file content. For each token generated by the tokenizer:
*   If it's a comment token (identified via the `onComment` callback), the comment text is trimmed and printed.
*   If it's a string literal token (`acorn.tokTypes.string`), its value is printed.
